## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project setup and structure

### Fixed
- Renovate now manages the `frontend/` npm ecosystem: added `npm` to
  `enabledManagers` (previously limited to `pep621` and `github-actions`, so
  npm dependency updates were silently skipped). npm is also included in the
  high-priority security-update rule and gets dedicated grouping rules
  matching the Python dependency grouping pattern.
